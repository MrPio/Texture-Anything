Your pixel-space loss pipeline is basically sound – you’re reconstructing an estimate of the clean latents $z_0$, decoding them back to image space, and then comparing to the original pixels with an MSE. Let’s walk through each step and check it against the standard DDPM formulas:

1. **Estimate $z_0$ from noisy latents**

   For DDPMs, given

   $$
     z_t = \sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}\,z_0 + \sqrt{1 - \bar\alpha_t}\,\varepsilon,
   $$

   and your model’s predicted noise $\hat\varepsilon = \texttt{model\_pred}$, the usual closed-form estimate of $z_0$ is

   $$
     \hat z_0 
     = \frac{z_t - \sqrt{1 - \bar\alpha_t}\,\hat\varepsilon}{\sqrt{\bar\alpha_t}}.
   $$

   You implement exactly this as:

   ```python
   alpha_bar = noise_scheduler.alphas_cumprod[timesteps]  # shape [B]
   z0_pred   = (noisy_latents
                - (1 - alpha_bar).sqrt()[:,None,None,None] * model_pred)
               / alpha_bar.sqrt()[:,None,None,None]
   ```

   ✅ **This matches the theory.**

2. **Scaling before/after VAE**

   Recall that your VAE’s `encode` multiplied latents by `scaling_factor`:

   ```python
   latents = vae.encode(...).latent_dist.sample()   # within [-∞,∞]
   latents = latents * vae.config.scaling_factor
   ```

   Hence to decode you must undo that scaling:

   ```python
   recon_images = vae.decode(z0_pred / vae.config.scaling_factor).sample
   ```

   ✅ **This is correct.**

3. **Pixel-space MSE**

   Finally you compare the reconstructed image against the original “ground-truth” pixel tensor:

   ```python
   pixel_loss = F.mse_loss(
       recon_images.float(),
       batch["pixel_values"].to(recon_images.device).float(),
       reduction="mean"
   )
   ```

   This is a straightforward per-pixel L2 loss.

### Caveats & potential improvements

* **Gradient flow**
  You’ve wrapped the reconstruction in `torch.no_grad()`, which means **no gradients** will flow through the VAE decoder into the rest of the network. If your intention is to learn the VAE jointly or fine-tune it, you’d remove that `no_grad()`. For a frozen VAE, `no_grad()` is appropriate.

* **Normalization / range**
  Ensure that your VAE’s input range (`batch["pixel_values"]`) matches the decoder’s output range (e.g. $[0,1]$ or $[-1,1]$). Mismatches here can lead to scaling issues in pixel-space loss.

* **Perceptual / LPIPS losses**
  An L2 pixel loss often correlates poorly with human perception. If you find blurry reconstructions, you might augment with a perceptual (e.g. VGG) or LPIPS term.

* **Weighting of losses**
  When you combine your original noise-prediction loss $L_{\mathrm{latent}}$ with this new pixel-space loss $L_{\mathrm{pixel}}$, tune their relative weighting. A simple sum

  $$
    L = L_{\mathrm{latent}} + \lambda\,L_{\mathrm{pixel}}
  $$

  often works, with $\lambda$ selected by cross-validation.

#### Conclusion

Yes — your method for computing a pixel-space reconstruction loss is correct and faithful to the DDPM formulation. Just be mindful of whether you want gradients through the decoder, range normalization, and how you weight this term against your latent loss.
