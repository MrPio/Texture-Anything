# Texture-Anything

Blender plugin to generate texture using StableDiffusion+ControlNet. The conditioning is on the UV map.

## ðŸ“¦ TL;DR

The goal of this project is to train a ControlNet on UV conditioning in order to generate textures for a model given its UV map. The dataset is a mix of Objaverse and [ShapeNetCore](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShapeNet/ShapeNetCore) and each sample is a triplet of _caption_, _UV map_ baked as image and _diffuse_ texture as ground truth.

## ðŸ“Œ How this repository is structured

The repository is structured in cronological sections, each containing several jupyter notebooks. The `src` module holds the recurrent code.

> [!NOTE]  
> As I haven't included the `.parquet` intermediary files due to their size, you should run all the notebooks one after the other, in order. The same holds for the final dataset, which is stored in `data/dataset/objaverse/`

### 1 Annotation Filtering

Here we clean and filter the annotation from the Objaverse dataset. (From $\approx 800,000$ to $\approx 70,000$ objects)

|  Notebook | Description   |
|---|---|
|[1.1-Filter_Annotations](1-annotations_filtering/1.1-Filter_Annotations.ipynb)   | - |
|[1.2-Visualize_Annotations](1-annotations_filtering/1.2-Visualize_Annotations.ipynb)   | - |
|[1.3-Check_Thumbnails](1-annotations_filtering/1.3-Check_Thumbnails.ipynb)   | - |
|[1.4-Model_Visualizer](1-annotations_filtering/1.4-Model_Visualizer.ipynb)   | - |

### 2 Objects Filtering

The $\approx 70,000$ objects are downloaded and further filtered for properties not yet available on the annotations.

|  Notebook | Description   |
|---|---|
|[2.1-Filter_Objects](2-objects_filtering/2.1-Filter_Objects.ipynb)   | - |
|[2.2-Generate_Dataset](2-objects_filtering/2.2-Generate_Dataset.ipynb)   | - |

### 3 Shape Net

The [ShapeNetCore](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShapeNet/ShapeNetCore) dataset is downloaded and analyzed. Is it that much cleaner than Objaverse?

|  Notebook | Description   |
|---|---|
|[3.1-Download_ShapeNet](3-shape_net/3.1-Download_ShapeNet.ipynb)   | - |
|[3.2-Model_Visualizer](3-shape_net/3.2-Model_Visualizer.ipynb)   | - |
